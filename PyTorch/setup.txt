Setup Documentation:

First, I downloaded Anaconda onto my Windows device via the following link:
	https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/

Jupyter Notebook should be available to launch from the Anaconda Navigator. If it is not, click 'Install'.

Then, I needed to download all of the following:
- pip
- pytorch
- pandas
- numpy
- cuda
- conda

To ensure pip is installed:
- Open PowerShell
- cd AppData/Local
- pip should be in there

Now, we launch the Anaconda PowerShell Prompt (the environment we will be using).

To install cuda, follow the documentation in the following link:
	https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html

Use the following commands to install PyTorch:
- conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch

To ensure installations are done:
- pip show torch (PyTorch)
- pip show pandas (pandas)
- pip show numpy (NumPy)
- nvcc -V (cuda)
- conda list (conda)
